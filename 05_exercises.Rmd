## Warm-up exercises from tutorial

  1. Choose 2 graphs you have created for ANY assignment in this class and add interactivity using the `ggplotly()` function.
```{r}
Weight_of_vegetables <- garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(wt_lbs = weight*0.00220462) %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = date , y = wt_lbs)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 7) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) +
 geom_point(color = 'green') +
 labs(title = "Weight of vegetables(lbs) over time(months)",
      x = "",
      y = "") +
 geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = 'dark blue') 
ggplotly(Weight_of_vegetables,
      tooltip = c("text", "x"))
```

```{r}
veggie_harvest <- garden_harvest %>% 
  group_by(vegetable) %>% 
  summarize(total_wt_lbs = sum(weight)*0.00220462) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = total_wt_lbs, 
               y = fct_reorder(vegetable, 
                               total_wt_lbs, 
                               .desc = FALSE),
               text = vegetable)) +
  labs(title = "Total Harvest by vegetable (lb)", 
       x = "Count",
       y = "")
ggplotly(veggie_harvest,
         tooltip = c("text", "x"))

```
  
  
  2. Use animation to tell an interesting story with the `small_trains` dataset that contains data from the SNCF (National Society of French Railways). These are Tidy Tuesday data! Read more about it [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-02-26).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
delay_small_trains <- small_trains %>%
  group_by(service) %>%
  filter(!is.na(service)) %>%
  filter(departure_station %in% c("PARIS EST", "PARIS LYON"))
delay3 <- delay_small_trains %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = avg_delay_all_departing, 
             y = service)) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  transition_states(year) +
  labs(title = "departing delay by French train services",
       x = "Average delay for departing drains in minutes",
       y = "train service",
       subtitle = "Moving to {next_state}")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
anim_save("trains2.gif", delay3)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("trains2.gif")
```

## Garden data

  3. In this exercise, you will create a stacked area plot that reveals itself over time (see the `geom_area()` examples [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/position_stack.html)). You will look at cumulative harvest of tomato varieties over time. You should do the following:
  * From the `garden_harvest` data, filter the data to the tomatoes and find the *daily* harvest in pounds for each variety.  
  * Then, for each variety, find the cumulative harvest in pounds.  
  * Use the data you just made to create a static cumulative harvest area plot, with the areas filled with different colors for each vegetable and arranged (HINT: `fct_reorder()`) from most to least harvested (most on the bottom).  
  * Add animation to reveal the plot over date. 

I have started the code for you below. The `complete()` function creates a row for all unique `date`/`variety` combinations. If a variety is not harvested on one of the harvest dates in the dataset, it is filled with a value of 0.

# i made some changes to the code written by the professor because it kept giving me an eror message 

```{r}

garden_harvest %>%
  filter(vegetable == "tomatoes") %>%
  complete(variety, date = seq.Date(min(date), max(date), by="day")) %>%
  select(-c(vegetable, units)) %>%
  mutate(weight = replace_na(weight, 0)) %>%
  group_by(variety, date) %>%
  summarize(daily_harvest_lb = sum(weight)*0.00220462) %>%
  mutate(cumsum_daily_harvest_lb = cumsum(daily_harvest_lb)) %>%
  select(-daily_harvest_lb) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_area(aes(x = date, y = cumsum_daily_harvest_lb, fill = variety), position = position_stack()) +
    transition_reveal(date) +
    labs(title = "Cumulative Harvest of Varieties of Tomatoes through Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Cumulative Daily Harvest",
       subtitle = "Moving to {frame_along}") 
 
```
```{r,eval=FALSE}
anim_save("harvest_area.gif")

```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("harvest_area.gif")
```

## Maps, animation, and movement!

  4. Map my `mallorca_bike_day7` bike ride using animation! 
  Requirements:
  * Plot on a map using `ggmap`.  
  * Show "current" location with a red point. 
  * Show path up until the current point.  
  * Color the path according to elevation.  
  * Show the time in the subtitle.  
  * CHALLENGE: use the `ggimage` package and `geom_image` to add a bike image instead of a red point. You can use [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llendway/animation_and_interactivity/master/bike.png) image. See [here](https://goodekat.github.io/presentations/2019-isugg-gganimate-spooky/slides.html#35) for an example. 
  * Add something of your own! And comment on if you prefer this to the static map and why or why not.
```{r}
bike_image_link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llendway/animation_and_interactivity/master/bike.png"
mallorca_bike_day7 <- mallorca_bike_day7 %>%
  mutate(image = bike_image_link)
mallorca_map <- get_stamenmap(
    bbox = c(left = 2.28, bottom = 39.41, right = 3.03, top = 39.8), 
    maptype = "terrain",
    zoom = 12
)
ggmap(mallorca_map) +
  geom_point(data = mallorca_bike_day7, 
             aes(x = lon, y = lat),
             color = "red", size = .5) +
  geom_path(data = mallorca_bike_day7, 
             aes(x = lon, y = lat, color = ele),
             size = .7) +
  labs(title = "Mallorca Bike Trail",
       subtitle = "Time: {frame_along}") +
  geom_image(data = mallorca_bike_day7,
            aes(x = lon, y = lat, image = bike_image_link), 
            size = 0.075) +
  transition_reveal(time) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "magma") +
  theme_map() +
  theme(legend.background = element_blank())
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
anim_save("bike1.gif")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("bike1.gif")
```
 I prefer this animated map more than the static map. This is because I think they look cooler and more fun, also i like it more because of the details it shows like the directions of the Lisa's bike ride. 
 
  5. In this exercise, you get to meet my sister, Heather! She is a proud Mac grad, currently works as a Data Scientist at 3M where she uses R everyday, and for a few years (while still holding a full-time job) she was a pro triathlete. You are going to map one of her races. The data from each discipline of the Ironman 70.3 Pan Am championships, Panama is in a separate file - `panama_swim`, `panama_bike`, and `panama_run`. Create a similar map to the one you created with my cycling data. You will need to make some small changes: 1. combine the files (HINT: `bind_rows()`, 2. make the leading dot a different color depending on the event (for an extra challenge, make it a different image using `geom_image()!), 3. CHALLENGE (optional): color by speed, which you will need to compute on your own from the data. You can read Heather's race report [here](https://heatherlendway.com/2016/02/10/ironman-70-3-pan-american-championships-panama-race-report/). She is also in the Macalester Athletics [Hall of Fame](https://athletics.macalester.edu/honors/hall-of-fame/heather-lendway/184) and still has records at the pool. 
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
total_trail <- panama_swim %>%
  bind_rows(list(panama_run, panama_bike)) 
  
panama_map <- get_stamenmap(
  bbox = c(left = -79.56, bottom = 8.88, right = -79.41, top = 9.001),
  maptype = "terrain",
  zoom = 11
)
ggmap(panama_map) +
  geom_point(data = total_trail, 
             aes(x = lon, y = lat, color = event, shape = event),
             size = 2) +
  geom_path(data = total_trail,
            aes(x = lon, y = lat, color = event),
            alpha = 0.8, size = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Ironman 70.3 Pan Am Championship",
       subtitle = "Time: {frame_along}") +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "magma") +
  theme_map() +
  theme(legend.background = element_blank()) +
  transition_reveal(time)
```
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
anim_save("panama.gif")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("panama.gif")
```
  
## COVID-19 data

  6. In this exercise, you are going to replicate many of the features in [this](https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/?region=US) visualization by Aitish Bhatia but include all US states. Requirements:
 * Create a new variable that computes the number of new cases in the past week (HINT: use the `lag()` function you've used in a previous set of exercises). Replace missing values with 0's using `replace_na()`.  
  * Filter the data to omit rows where the cumulative case counts are less than 20.  
  * Create a static plot with cumulative cases on the x-axis and new cases in the past 7 days on the x-axis. Connect the points for each state over time. HINTS: use `geom_path()` and add a `group` aesthetic.  Put the x and y axis on the log scale and make the tick labels look nice - `scales::comma` is one option. This plot will look pretty ugly as is.
  * Animate the plot to reveal the pattern by date. Display the date as the subtitle. Add a leading point to each state's line (`geom_point()`) and add the state name as a label (`geom_text()` - you should look at the `check_overlap` argument).  
  * Use the `animate()` function to have 200 frames in your animation and make it 30 seconds long. 
  * Comment on what you observe.
  
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}

covid19 %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(lag7 = lag(cases, 7, order_by = date)) %>%
  replace_na(list(lag7 = 0)) %>%
  mutate(new_cases_past_week = cases - lag7) %>%
  filter(cases >= 20) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = cases, y = new_cases_past_week, group = state)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_path(color = "light blue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = state), check_overlap = TRUE) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Trajectory of US COVID-19 Confirmed Cases",
    x = "Total Confirmed Cases",
    y = "New Confirmed Cases (in the Past Week)",
    subtitle = "Date: {frame_along}"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  transition_reveal(date) -> covid19trajectory_gganim
animate(covid19trajectory_gganim,
        nframes = 200,
        duration = 30)
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
anim_save("covid2.gif")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("covid2.gif")
```
The plot shows the drastic surge in COVID-19 cases in New York and New Jersey at the beginning of the pandemic. We can make a lot of observations since the plot includes all the states. For example, we can see that a state like Vermont was doing well in dealing with COVID-19 as their new confirmed cases in a week drop quickly in June, then see an increase again at the end of June and fall again at the start of August. Furthermore, their total number of confirmed cases is extremely low, around 1,200 people during the entire pandemic especially when compared to other states. We can also see that some states were not doing well with covid cases increasing a lot such as in FL and TX starting from July through september. 

  
  7. In this exercise you will animate a map of the US, showing how cumulative COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents has changed over time. This is similar to exercises 11 & 12 from the previous exercises, with the added animation! So, in the end, you should have something like the static map you made there, but animated over all the days. Put date in the subtitle. Comment on what you see. The code below gives the population estimates for each state. Because there are so many dates, you are going to only do the animation for all Fridays. So, use `wday()` to create a day of week variable and filter to all the Fridays. HINT: use `group = date` in `aes()`.

```{r}

census_pop_est_2018 <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/6txwv3b4ng7pepe/us_census_2018_state_pop_est.csv?dl=1") %>% 
  separate(state, into = c("dot","state"), extra = "merge") %>% 
  select(-dot) %>% 
  mutate(state = str_to_lower(state))
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
covid19_population <-
  covid19 %>% 
  mutate(state = str_to_lower(state)) %>%
  left_join(census_pop_est_2018,
            by = "state") %>% 
  group_by(state, est_pop_2018, date) %>%
  summarize(cumulative_cases = max(cases)) %>%
  mutate(cases_per_10000 = (cumulative_cases/est_pop_2018)*10000)
states_map <- map_data("state")
covid_map <- covid19_population %>% 
  mutate(state = str_to_lower(state), weekday = wday(date, label=TRUE)) %>%
  filter(weekday == "Fri") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_map(map = states_map,
           aes(map_id = state, fill = cases_per_10000, group = date)) +
  expand_limits(x = states_map$long, y = states_map$lat) + 
  labs(title = "Cumulative COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people in the US") +
  theme(legend.background = element_blank()) + 
  theme_map() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  transition_states(date, transition_length = 0) +
  labs(subtitle = "Moving to {next_state}")
animate(covid_map, duration = 30)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
anim_save("covid.gif", covid_map)
```
  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("covid.gif")
```
 This shows how covid-19 cases are increasing in the US. It starts with the number of cases per 10000 people in NY, AZ and LA increasing rapidly. After that, almost every other state in the US follows the same trend of increasing numbers of cases. Some states like Vermont, Maine and Oregon do not have a rapidly increasing cases like the majority of the states. Then by the end we see the US map lights up in green and yellow indicating that almost every state has close to 200-300 cases per 10,000 people. 
  

## Your first `shiny` app (for next week!)

NOT DUE THIS WEEK! If any of you want to work ahead, this will be on next week's exercises.

  8. This app will also use the COVID data. Make sure you load that data and all the libraries you need in the `app.R` file you create. Below, you will post a link to the app that you publish on shinyapps.io. You will create an app to compare states' cumulative number of COVID cases over time. The x-axis will be number of days since 20+ cases and the y-axis will be cumulative cases on the log scale (`scale_y_log10()`). We use number of days since 20+ cases on the x-axis so we can make better comparisons of the curve trajectories. You will have an input box where the user can choose which states to compare (`selectInput()`) and have a submit button to click once the user has chosen all states they're interested in comparing. The graph should display a different line for each state, with labels either on the graph or in a legend. Color can be used if needed.
